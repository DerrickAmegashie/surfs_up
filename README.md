## Overview of Surfs_Up_Analysis

The project involved using SQLite, SQLAlchemy and flask for statistical analysis. Ken want to develop a surf n  shake shop to  sell ice cream and surf boards to locals and tourist. Ken reached out to an investor (WAV) to help him achieve this dream of mine. Before investing, the investor has concerns about the weather, so he needed me to provide weather analysis on a data of the said location of the shop which is the island of Oahu.

Once I completed the above task, I was further tasked to provide additional information about the temperature trends. Specifically the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. The reason for this task was to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round.
